# Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft as a **typed superset of JavaScript**. This means it extends the capabilities of JavaScript by adding extra features while still allowing you to write regular JavaScript code. The key benefit is that TypeScript provides **static typing** and **type checking**, which help catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.

## Alternative to JavaScript

While JavaScript is widely used for building web applications, TypeScript offers additional features that make it easier to manage large and complex codebases. Since TypeScript **compiles down to JavaScript**, it can be run anywhere JavaScript runs, such as in browsers, Node.js, and various other platforms.

## Strict Types

TypeScript's biggest strength is its ability to enforce **strict types**. By using explicit type annotations, developers can ensure that variables, functions, and objects are used in ways that align with their intended behavior, reducing bugs and improving code readability.
