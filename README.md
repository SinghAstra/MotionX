# Animated Component Library

A practical learning project combining shadCn/ui components with Framer Motion animations. Built to understand animation fundamentals while creating reusable UI components.

## Why This Project?

- Learn Framer Motion fundamentals through hands-on component building
- Understand animation best practices in React applications
- Create a reusable library of animated components based on shadCn/ui
- Practice implementing accessible animations with reduced motion support

## Core Goals

1. Master basic Framer Motion concepts:

   - Animation variants
   - Transitions and gestures
   - Exit animations
   - Layout animations

2. Build practical components:

   - Animated buttons with meaningful feedback
   - Smooth modal transitions
   - Engaging loading states
   - Interactive cards

3. Focus on maintainability:
   - Clean animation configs
   - Reusable animation presets
   - Well-documented components
   - Accessibility first
